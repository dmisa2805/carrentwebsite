## ⚙️ React + Vite

This project uses the [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev) template, providing a fast and modern development experience with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint integration.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### ✅ Expanding ESLint Configuration

For production applications, it's recommended to:
- Use **TypeScript**
- Enable **type-aware linting** using [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io)

Check out the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for a starting point.
